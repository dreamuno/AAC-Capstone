                The Academic Assessment Committee has not yet assigned a report to your department. Contact the Academic
                Assessment Committee if you believe this is an error.

                This means an Academic Assessment Committee member has reviewed your report and returned it to you for
                modifications. You can see feedback by clicking the 'Feedback' button, and can make the necessary
                modifications by clicking 'Modify' and navigating to the required section. After the requested
                modifications have been made, you can resubmit the report when ready.

            <h3>What does the to-do list mean when completing a report?</h3>
            <p>
                The to-do list automatically updates as you complete the report. The list in each section covers the
                materials in that section, as well as prior sections. The to-do list contains two parts: required and 
                suggested. The required section lists what must be completed in the report before you can submit it to the 
                Academic Assessment Committee. If you feel one of these requirements does not apply to your degree program, 
                contact the Academic Assessment Committee, and they will submit the report on your behalf. The suggested 
                section contains automated suggestions based upon the rubric. Sometimes these suggestions will not apply or 
                be accurate for a given degree program. You will be able to submit the report without acting upon any of these 
                suggestions. Please use your best judgement when viewing these suggestions. Finally, the to-do list disappears
                if there are no more suggestions or requirements to complete.

            <h3>What is CSV?</h3>
            <p>
                The acronym CSV stands for 'comma-separated values'. This file type allows you to export the data within the 
                system in a comma seperated list. CSV files can be easily imported into programs such as Excel, which gives you
                the option to transfer data for further analysis.

                The application can only include files that were already PDF's in the report PDF. Other supplements can still be
                downloaded seperately.

            <h3>How can I see reports to review?</h3>
            <p>
                With the top navigation bar, go to the 'Administration' tab. From there, click the 'Reports' link, and you can 
                search for not yet reviewed and submitted reports.

            <h3>What does 'Generate Reports' do?</h3>
            <p>
                When degree programs are created, there is an option to assign a cycle length and starting year. For example,
                if 2015 is the starting year and 4 is the cycle length, reports should be assigned in 2015, 2019, 2023, 2027, etc.
                Generating a year's reports assigns a report with the selected rubric to every degree program whose starting year
                and cycle length combination indicates it should be assigned a report in that given year. However, it does not
                assign a report if a given degree program has already been manually assigned a report for the given year. Further, 
                not not all degree programs will have a cycle length and starting year, in which case this button will never assign 
                the program a report.

            <h3>How do I manually assign a report?</h3>
            <p>
                From the Departments & Programs page on the navigation bar, find the desired degree program, or department the degree
                program is in. There will be an option to 'Assign Report', which will take you to the appropriate form.
